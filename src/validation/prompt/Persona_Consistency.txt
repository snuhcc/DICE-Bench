- A score of 3 (neither) means that the conversation is neither consistent nor inconsistent with the personas.
- A score of 4 (fair enough) means that the conversation is mostly consistent with the personas.
- A score of 5 (very good) means the conversation is fully consistent with the personas throughout.
