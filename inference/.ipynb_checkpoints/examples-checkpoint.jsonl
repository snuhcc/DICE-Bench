Wasn't the plan to fly from Incheon Airport to Paris?  \nUser C: That's right. Just securing the flight tickets will make the rest of the planning much easier.  \nUser A: Agreed. Even if the schedule changes later, we can check for refundable or changeable options.  \nUser B: If we go with a morning flight, it'll give us some breathing room once we land.  \nUser C: Alright, I'll ask the system to handle it. Book a flight for us."}

How about picking up the car on the morning of September 3 and returning it on the afternoon of September 7?  \nUser C: A sedan should be enough since we don\u2019t have many people.  \nUser A: Right. If needed, we can add insurance or extra options later.  \nUser B: Alright, let\u2019s ask the system to make the booking.  \nUser C: Alright, I\u2019ll ask the system to handle it.
